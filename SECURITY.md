# Reporting security issues

For common issues the recommended way is to open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/jaesivsm/JARR/issues/new).

For security issues related to either JARR itself or its [main instance](https://app.jarr.info), the best way is to contact [the main maintenaner by mail](mailto:contact@jarr.info).
